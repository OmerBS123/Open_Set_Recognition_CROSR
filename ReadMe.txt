To run with training set is_training variable in the run_notebook file to True
This will train the net and evaluate it
If is_training = False the notebook will load the network from the model_weights folder and evaluate only.

Assuming you have coda available the notebook will run in under 10 min if not then it will take approximately 17 min

Make sure the entire CROSR framework is in the same folder as run_notebook, this is the default case but in case of some editing.

The plots from the entire training are placed in the Plots folder in the CROSR folder.
